## Overview <IMG SRC=http://theweeks.org/tmp/PICS/LCBB/laser-bot.png align=right width=400>

This is the code for the three hour, hands on [Lets Code Blacksburg Collision Bot arduino Robotics Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/18949799360).. as well as the shorter, more intro level [Martian Laser-Bot coding activity](https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/LCBB_arduino-collision-bot/blob/master/arduino-robotics-laser-bot-lab.pdf).

The collision-bot (aka "Laser Bot") workshop build document steps you through building a foam board, arduino based collision-avoidance bot. See PDF instruction and code below.  The collision-bot workshop takes around 3 hours and you can buy all the parts off Amazon or AliExpress.com for around $30.

As an additional hands on activity (after you've built a few laser-bots), you can run a shorter (20min), much more simple hands on ["Martian Laser-Bot Mission" activity](https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/LCBB_arduino-collision-bot/blob/master/arduino-robotics-laser-bot-lab.pdf) that is both a lot of fun, as well as geared much more to the beginner coder.

> TEACHERS: If you build 3-4 collision-bots (with lasers) ahead of time, you can use them along 
> with the Martian laser-bot mission to introduce kids to very simple, intro level robotics programming 
> (via arduino IDE in C++).  Then after their hooked, move them on to the full 3 hour, hands on 
> Collision-Bot workshop (below) where they can build and take home their own laser-bot.


## Collision-Bot Workshop: (advanced level)
To get started on the hands on, three hour workshop to build and code your collision-bots from scratch..

1.  Download the [collision bot workshop build doc PDF](https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/LCBB_arduino-collision-bot/blob/master/PDF_arduino-robotics-collision-bot.pdf) and build the bot (requires 5"x6" foam board, 2 milk jug caps, 1 soda cap, arduino, two continuous servos and a US-100 ping sensor, optional 5mW laser and hot glue.)

2. Download and run the 2_blink test code and verify your arduino hardware and software are working

3. Next, download 3_ping_US-100_and_laser.ino.. build/upload and THEN hook up the US-100 ping sensor (do not connect ping sensor until you have uploaded/run the code!)

4. Download the 4_two-servos-test.ino code, tune the stopL, stopR values solid stopAll() functionality (and optionally forwardL, forwardR values to ensure your bot goes in a straight line).

5. Completing the bot's code:
* 5a For experienced coders, combine ping and sevo code to make autonomous bot
* 5b For inexperienced coders, download the 5b_collision-bot_complete.ino code and tune your stopL and stopR values
* 5c For doing the ["Mission to Mars" mission PDF](https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/LCBB_arduino-collision-bot/blob/master/arduino-robotics-laser-bot-lab.pdf), and download [5c_Laser_Bot_Mission_to_Mars.ino code](https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/LCBB_arduino-collision-bot/blob/master/5c_Laser_Bot_Mission_to_Mars.ino) and program bot movements on another planet! (can you find and fix the laser cannon bug?)

For a stretch goal, have your more advanced students employ the getDist() function in [5c_Laser_Bot_Mission_to_Mars.ino code](https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/LCBB_arduino-collision-bot/blob/master/5c_Laser_Bot_Mission_to_Mars.ino) to detect objects in the bot's path to make your very own autonomous collision-avoiding robot, or even shoot things with the laser that get in the path of your robot!

## Additional Martian Laser-Bot Mission: (intro level)
The Laser-Bot Mission to Mars coding activity uses the previously built collision-bot (w/5000 ÂµWatt laser cannon). The Martian Laser-Bot mission is a much less intensive, more intro level coding activity.  In this shorter (20 minute) intro  level hands on coding activity, each student is tasked with programming their already built, [code-complete](https://github.com/LetsCodeBlacksburg/LCBB_arduino-collision-bot/blob/master/5c_Laser_Bot_Mission_to_Mars.ino) laser-bot rover to navigate the mountainous Martian terrain, find the alien armada, and take them out with their laser cannon before they launch their attack on Earth!
